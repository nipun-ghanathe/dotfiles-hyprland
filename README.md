Configuration files for Hyprland and other tools

The font used is ttf-firacode-nerd.

The colors are taken from the same theme that Graphite-gtk-theme uses - [2014 Material Design Color Palette](https://m2.material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors). I have mainly used the `300` colors.
